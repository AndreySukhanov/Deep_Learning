Perceptron - classification possibilities.

Perceptron is a simple algorithm used for binary classification tasks. It is a type of linear classifier that uses a single layer of artificial neurons to make predictions. The algorithm works by adjusting the weights of the input features in order to find the best boundary between the classes.

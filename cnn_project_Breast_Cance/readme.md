Project Breast Cancer Detection with CNN

CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is a type of deep learning neural network that is commonly used in image and video recognition tasks. It is designed to process data that has a grid-like topology, such as an image, by using convolutional layers to scan the image and extract features. This allows the network to learn to recognize patterns and objects within the image, and can be used for tasks such as object detection, image classification, and video analysis. This is a learning project.

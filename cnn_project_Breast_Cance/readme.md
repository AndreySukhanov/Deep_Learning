Project: Breast Cancer Detection with CNN

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used for the detection of breast cancer by analyzing images of breast tissue, such as mammograms. CNNs are particularly useful for this task because they are able to identify patterns and features in images that can indicate the presence of cancer. The process typically involves training a CNN on a dataset of labeled images (i.e. images that have been identified as containing cancer or not) and then using the trained CNN to classify new images as either positive for cancer or negative. This is a training project showing the work of convolutional neural networks.
